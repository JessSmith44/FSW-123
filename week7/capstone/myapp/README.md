    For my capstone project I decided to go with a blog style app. I feel like it is a project that you can add allot of personality too while keeping things simple and elegant. I have 10 components that all have a specific functionality, Home, About and post are the linked pages set up with the navbar. My footer and header component that can be reused across future projects. A missing page to display if a post/page is not found. New post component to add a new post on to the blog, post to display the details for each post, postPage to display the specific post clicked on for a single post read. Feed post to display all posts available. I have been through many errors on this project. Starting with an error that caused me to need to restart the entire project, upon restarting the project I got the same error however for a different reason. Once I resolved that, it was a simple matter of correcting small syntax errors such as an extra s where it was not needed! And making sure a function that was being passed as a prop was in fact being used. All in all this was an eye opening project to do, as it really tested all my abilities to debug and fix issues that were present, some of which I did require an extra pair of eyes for(thank you academic consultants!). I had allot of fun making this application, despite the stress of resolving strange errors. 








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
